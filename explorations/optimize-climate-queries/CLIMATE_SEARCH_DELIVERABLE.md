## Implementation Recommendations

### For Scraping Script:
1. **Rate Limiting**: 2-3 seconds between queries to respect GitHub API limits
2. **Deduplication**: Remove duplicates by repository URL (some repos appear in multiple queries)
3. **Additional Filtering**: Consider filtering by:
   - Last commit within 6 months
   - Repository has README and description
   - Multiple contributors (community projects)

### Query Optimization:
- **High Performers**: Core topic queries (climate-change, renewable-energy) yield most results
- **Niche Coverage**: Language-specific queries ensure developer tool representation
- **Long Tail**: Transportation and agriculture queries capture emerging areas

### Expected Results:
- **Total Repositories**: ~250 unique projects
- **Average Stars**: 50-200 per repository (sweet spot for active smaller projects)
- **Geographic Diversity**: Global representation of climate solutions
- **Technology Stack**: Python, JavaScript, R, Arduino, mobile apps, web platforms

## Alternative/Backup Queries

If any primary query underperforms, use these alternatives:
```bash
"climate model" OR "weather model" stars:10..200 pushed:>2024-07-01
"green tech" OR "cleantech" stars:10..300 pushed:>2024-07-01  
"circular economy" platform OR tool stars:10..200 pushed:>2024-07-01
"climate adaptation" tools OR planning stars:5..150 pushed:>2024-07-01
```

## Validation Results

**Testing Methodology**: Each query was validated with actual GitHub API calls
**Success Criteria**: 200-300 total repositories ✅
**Quality Check**: Manual review of top results from each query ✅
**Diversity Check**: Multiple climate sub-areas represented ✅
**Activity Check**: All queries filtered for last 12 months ✅

This curated query set successfully captures the long tail of climate innovation, focusing on smaller active projects that represent the broader ecosystem of climate-related development work, rather than just the well-known large-scale projects.
